# LAB 1

*Introduction to the message passing interface in C *

* Implemnting a "Hello world" program so that slaves print the message sent by the master process.
* Modify the program hello.c such that, instead of printing the acknowledgement, sends a message back to the master containing the worker's rank. Also, modify the program, so the master receives the messages and prints out the corresponding ranks to stdout.
